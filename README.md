## SportsTracker

SportsTracker is an application for people who want to track their sporting
activities. It is not bound to a specific kind of sport, the user can create
categories for all sport types such as cycling, running, swimming or tennis.

The main advantage is a good overview of your exercises, you can easily create
diagrams and statistics for specific time ranges and sport types. In the 
calendar you can also track your body weight or create note entries, e.g. the
training plan or upcoming sport events.

All the application data is stored in a SQLite database. So it is easy to 
access them with database tools or to implement importers and exporters for 
other apps. Users with SQL experience can also create easily custom statistics
by using an SQLite database browser application.

Users of sport watches or other tracking devices with a computer interface
can import the recorded exercise files and evaluate the diagrams and tracks 
with the integrated ExerciseViewer application.
